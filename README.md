React-Jobly is a mock job search platform built using React and Create-React-App. This project simulates a functional job board where users can browse and apply for job listings. It interacts with a backend API to retrieve job data, user information, and handle job applications. The goal of this app is to provide a smooth, interactive job search experience, mirroring what you might find on a real-world job site.
